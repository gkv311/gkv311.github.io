*Kirill Gavrilov* is the Russian programmer who created sView project.
He's a native of Kirishi, and is currently employed by [Open Cascade](https://opencascade.com), Nizhny Novgorod (as Software Architect).
As employee of Open Cascade, he participates in development of [Open CASCADE Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org) platform (resposible for [3D Visualization domain](https://dev.opencascade.org/index.php?q=home/projects/visualization)),
3D Viewer and convertor for 3D models [CAD Assistant](https://www.opencascade.com/content/cad-assistant),
as well as in other projects.

Stereo-visualization has been a long time passion for him, but he was frustrated to find no Stereoscopic video players that met his needs.
As a result he started to develop his own stereo-viewing software and sView is the result.

It's also FREE, cross-platform and available for Linux, Windows and OS X.
Feedback is encouraged while development continues.
