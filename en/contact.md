*Kirill Gavrilov Tartynskih* is the Russian programmer who created sView project.
He's a native of Kirishi, and is currently employed by [Open Cascade](https://opencascade.com), Nizhny Novgorod (as Software Architect).
As employee of Open Cascade, he participates in development of [Open CASCADE Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org) platform (responsible for 3D Visualization domain),
3D Viewer and converter for 3D models [CAD Assistant](https://dev.opencascade.org/project/cad-assistant),
as well as in other projects.

Stereo-visualization has been a long time passion for him, but he was frustrated to find no Stereoscopic video players that met his needs.
As a result he started to develop his own stereo-viewing software and sView is the result.

It's also open-source, cross-platform and available for Linux, Windows, Android and macOS.
Feedback is encouraged while development continues.
