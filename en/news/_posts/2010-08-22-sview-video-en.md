I'm pleased to present a new version of sView!

A lot of work has been done since previous release in 2008 year.
New version supports more stereoscopic devices, introduces **video playback** (!), mouse control, file drag & drop, and a lot of new features.
The following projects have been used to improve functionality of sView: FFmpeg, OpenAL soft, DevIL, FTGL, GLEW.

Updated version is already available on download section. Enjoy!
