sView 15.10 with improved panorama output support is available on all supported platforms (Windows, OS X, Ubuntu, Android).
Main changes in new version:

* Support reading cubemaps in format 3:2 (two rows per 3 quad sides, as on video [Star Wars on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/StarWars/videos/1030579940326940/)).
* Added button to activate 360 panorama view (from cubemap or spherical panorama videos and images) on toolbar.
* Added Czech translation files (thanks to Marek Audy).
* Added new demo image, prepared by Paul Eckhardt ([bricklightstudios.com](http://bricklightstudios.com/)).
* Add option to automatically workaround aspect ratio of anamorphic 1080p and 720p videos.
* Implemented device orientation tracking within panorama mode on Android (requires precise sensors).
* Improved handling of last opened file and settings storage on Android.
