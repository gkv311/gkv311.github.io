sView 15.08 with updated user interface is available on all supported platforms (Windows, OS X, Ubuntu, Android).
Main changes in new version:

* Cubemap images support (6 sides of the cube stacked horizontally).
* Added hot-keys configuration dialog.
* Fixed issue with HiDPI displays within multi-monitor configurations on Windows 8.1+.
* Added volume bar and shuffle/loop buttons to Media Player.
* Updated User Interface - more compact interface, new icons in menu, add scrollbars, improved HiDPI support.
* Improved integration into Ubuntu - fixed missing icons on taskbar.
* Improved touch-screens support.
* Many minor corrections.

Cubemap is an alternative to spherical panoramas (supported by sView for a long time) providing better image quality.
You can download many stereoscopic cubemaps from [contest on otoy.com](https://home.otoy.com/vr-competition/winners/).
