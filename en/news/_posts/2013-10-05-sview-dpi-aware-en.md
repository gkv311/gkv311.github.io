sView 13.10 has been released.
The key change is DPI awareness (Windows Vista+, Mac OS X Snow Leopard+, Linux - XLib)
and per-monitor DPI support (Windows 8.1, Mac OS X Lion+).
Now User Interface can be scaled to improve experience on high pixel density displays (Retina, 4K).

Full changes list is available on [this page](/en/sview/history).
